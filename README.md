# Etch-a-sketch
This project was a lot of fun to me. I really had to figure out how to implement the "slow black" feature without getting my code to be so messy (hopefully it isn't XD), and I think that this feature was the most interesting part of this project for me personally. 

I learned the following:
1. How to convert between color formats using string manipulation (I had to convert from the hex format to the rgb format for "slow black" to work).
2. How to manipulate the DOM. And at this point, I think I can do that easily without having to think a lot about it.
3. How to display a grid of divs using flexbox, and I am looking forward to learning more about the css grid to accomplish such a thing in the future!
